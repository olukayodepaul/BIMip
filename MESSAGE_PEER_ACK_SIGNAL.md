##  ✅ MessagePeerAckSignal

The `MessagePeerAckSignal` is the primary acknowledgment signal. It is generated by the recipient/server and sent back to the original message sender. It conveys the delivery status and, critically, the **server-generated stream state** (`Peer` object).

### Protobuf Definition

```protobuf
message MessagePeerAckSignal {
  Identity to = 1;
  Identity from = 2;
  string message_id = 3;
  int32 method = 4;
  int64 timestamp = 5;
  int32 status_code = 6;
  Peer peer = 7;
}
```
